7-Factor Scoring Algorithm (100 points total):
Block Consistency (25 points) - Measures how well blocks agree across RPCs
Transaction Consistency (20 points) - Validates transaction data consistency
RPC Health & Availability (20 points) - Tracks endpoint health status
Response Time Performance (15 points) - Network latency and speed
Network Reliability (10 points) - Overall success rate tracking
Data Freshness (5 points) - How recent the blockchain data is
Error Rate Penalty (up to -5 points) - Penalizes high failure rates
Advanced Features Added:

✅ Performance Grades: A+ to F letter grades (A+ = 90+, A = 80+, etc.)
✅ Enhanced Alerts: Specific alerts for RPC health and latency issues
✅ Smart Thresholds: Context-aware scoring based on real network conditions
Frontend Enhancements:
✅ Visual Score Breakdown: Interactive progress bars for each factor
✅ Grade Display: Letter grades with color-coded badges
✅ Factor Analysis: Real-time breakdown showing what affects the score
✅ Enhanced Tooltips: Detailed explanations for each scoring component
Real-World Scoring Examples:
90-100 (A+): Perfect network with fast responses, all RPCs healthy
80-89 (A): Excellent performance with minor latency
70-79 (B): Good performance with some consistency issues
60-69 (C): Acceptable but with notable problems
50-59 (D): Poor performance requiring attention
0-49 (F): Critical issues needing immediate action
